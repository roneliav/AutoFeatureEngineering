# AutoFeaureEngineering
Auto arithemtic feater engineerging for training and inference:

1. Applying oneiric operations on each numeric column, such as log, exp, etcâ€¦
2. Applying actions on two columns (multiplying a column by column).
3. Dividing columns into quantiles according to a variety of options (deciles/exceptions).
4. Filling missing values (filling with zeros or with the column avg.).

We test this approch on 4 datasets, attahced in the notebook, and got a better model for all of them.
